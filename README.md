	-Design, write and debug more complex classes than you have previously written
	-Use inheritance and polymorhpism in your programs
	-Implement graphical user interfaces and Applets
	-Implement recursive solutions to problems
	-Create programs that mimic real-world software (e.g., simulations, games, text clouds, etc)
	-Design and use test cases to ensure the correctness of your programs
	-Practice good documentation habits
	-Work in Unix environment, and run programs from the command line
